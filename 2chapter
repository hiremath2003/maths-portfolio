    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Probability is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of uncertainty.
        It helps in predicting the likelihood of occurrence of an event.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Definition of Probability</h2>
    <p>
        Probability of an event is defined as the ratio of the number of favorable
        outcomes to the total number of equally likely outcomes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b> P(E) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Interpretation of Probability Value</h2>
    <p>
        The value of probability always lies between 0 and 1.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>P(E) = 0 → Event is impossible</li>
        <li>P(E) = 1 → Event is certain</li>
        <li>0 &lt; P(E) &lt; 1 → Event is possible</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Addition Rule of Probability</h2>
    <p>
        The addition rule is used to find the probability of occurrence of at least one
        of the two events.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b> P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) − P(A ∩ B)
    </p>
    <p>
        If A and B are mutually exclusive:
        <br>
        <b>P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)</b>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Multiplication Rule of Probability</h2>
    <p>
        The multiplication rule is used to find the probability of occurrence of two
        events together.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b> P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B | A)
    </p>
    <p>
        If A and B are independent:
        <br>
        <b>P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)</b>
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Bayes’ Rule</h2>
    <p>
        Bayes’ rule is used to find the conditional probability of an event when some
        related information is given.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b>
        <br>
        P(A | B) = [P(B | A) × P(A)] / P(B)
    </p>
    <p>
        Bayes’ theorem is widely used in statistics, machine learning, and decision
        making.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Probability plays a vital role in predicting uncertain events. Understanding its
        rules and applications helps in solving real-world problems efficiently.
